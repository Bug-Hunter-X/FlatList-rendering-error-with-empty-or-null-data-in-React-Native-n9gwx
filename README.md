# React Native FlatList Empty Data Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue and its solution when using FlatList in React Native with potentially empty or null data fetched asynchronously. The issue arises when the FlatList attempts to render before the data has been fetched or if the fetched data is empty, leading to errors or unexpected behavior. 

The solution includes robust error handling and conditional rendering to gracefully manage these scenarios.

## Problem
The provided `DataFetch.js` file contains a component that fetches data from an API.  The `FlatList` component attempts to render immediately, potentially before data is available leading to errors. 

## Solution
The `DataFetchSolution.js` file showcases the corrected version. This version checks if `data` is defined and has a length greater than 0 before rendering the list. If no data is available, it displays a helpful message instead of crashing. 

This approach ensures a more robust and user-friendly experience when dealing with dynamic data in React Native.
